Email has its own standards but each service provider has its own specifics. For QQ mail, the problem
is with the time span. I have found in Jan 2020 that mails before 2014 cannot be retrived using IMAP protocol and improper
handling of such error message will crash your client. Therefore, I use manual backup method
to save what I think important email. The manual method is to resend these old emails to myself, thus updating its time.
